## **Lost Memories\*: Main Page**

*\*A reference to Lost Memories of Silent Hill\**

Hi, my name is Ruslan. In this text I'm talking about the main page of Associative Connection – a site dedicated to three subgenres of Cyberpunk: Biopunk, Mythpunk, Dreampunk, as well as the horror genre.

### **What's the need?**

Probably you are not my close acquaintance yet, just as I am not a person whose work is usually "interpreted". In this text you will find out what I was thinking about while creating three animated collages, as well as…

* How I connect Biopunk, Mythpunk, and Dreampunk.  
* Why is there a divination ball at the end of the page.

Each frame is exactly where I planned it to be and this is the eighth version of the original mosaic I wanted to put together.

#### **Warnings**

* Associative Connections is a site for adults.  
* To disable the sound effects, simply click on the horn icon

## **Biopunk, Mythpunk, and Dreampunk**

**Biopunk** is a genre of stories where the trigger for the development of events is experimentation with genetic engineering or the result from the purposeful as well as accidental use of biological weapons.

* Biopunk is the subject of an interesting book.  
* Unlike the next two genres the background of this genre is always sci-fi.

**Mythpunk** is a term coined in 2006 by writer Katherine Valente to define her book series The Orphan's Tales.

* Mythpunk utilizes mythological and folkloric strains in postmodern fantasy stories.  
* Mythpunk is an ethical alternative to the term "New Age", which within the company of reconstructors of traditional religions is characterized as eclectic neo-paganism and speaks of a superficial attitude to the lore of any single religion, which for some is unacceptable.

**Dreampunk** is a kind of somnambulist, a matrix within which the characters travel through a dream world or find themselves in a dreamlike reality.

* The hallmark of Dreampunk is its layered narrative, sometimes with references to alchemy, the occult, but most often psychoanalysis.

Three sections inhabit this page, each inspired by one of these genre trends.

* Spiritis Shopw is biopunk inspired  
* Culture – inspired by Mythpunk  
* Insanity is inspired by Dreampunk

## **Section One: Spiritis Shopw**

Spiritis Shopw – is a play on words and a reference to the Gravity Falls TV series. Just as during the show's opener one letter fell down and "Mystery Shack" became "Mystery Hack", here the letter "p" of the neon sign is turned off and the new letter next to it is "w".

*I'm currently writing a black comedy story about a man who used to sell high-end alcohol, but then the war broke out, he had trouble exporting and decided to revive the fashion for Ouija sessions popular during WWII. Then the main character began to summon spirits, while continuing to sell other "drinks".*

Do logistics really suffer in times of war? Yes, but in the case of exporting alcohol or tobacco products – it would only suffer in a "perfect Tolkienian world" where the orcs would pass a dry law for lack of hobbit mead.

### **Samotrolling and the lost line in the cv**

I'm a website developer by trade. My last contracts were with companies that sell alcohol. At the end of 2022 my contracts came to an end, but at the beginning of 2023 an opportunity came up to develop a website... Drum roll.....

Ouija boards.

Looking for the bottom of the Kohl's super deep hellhole as well as drilling the world through seems like a bad idea to me, so I gave up, but in truth it's a plot for a black comedy.

### **Biopunk**

Sometimes a biological weapon causes hallucinations and stupefied victims believe it is gnosis. Sometimes the biological weapon thinks it is a little girl and makes others believe it is. Lots of situations and they all remotely resemble alcohol intoxication, which is generally not strange. Alcohol is a poison.

So, the Spirits Shopw section is dedicated to dope, the extent of which subsequently influenced the social order of society.

**Copywrites**  
Hovering over one of the tags imitating double strands of DNA will play a refrain of an old American children's song used in one of my favorite games – RE 7\.

### **Describing test tube shots as a reference to tasting alcohol sets**

The first is Propellerhead (the same one that was in Frankenstein's Army and later appeared in Resident Evil: Village).  
The second is the cover of the movie Gothic (1986), featuring Natasha Richardson as Mary Shelley. The cover in its turn almost exactly repeats the plot of The Nightmare (1781), which according to some critics foreshadowed Jungian ideas about the unconscious.  
The third is a movie adaptation of Lovecraft's story about Herbert Wells, who parodying Frankenstein: or, Shelley's The Modern Prometheus created the "first zombies" (a dead body animated through chemistry, not as in the case of Shelley's monster – a dead body raised by electricity).

In the front row in the center is Shelley, and flanked by creatives inspired by her monster.

Fourth is a screenshot from the comic strip Freeze.Shut up.  
The fifth is a fan animation of Dimitrescu found on a porn site. For the sake of comedy, I blurred her nipples at the same moment making them rated lower (oh, yeah).  
Sixth is the cover of the second episode of the series Temple on the Pogost. Temple on the Pogost – my old story originally dedicated to the god Surt, on the basis of which I started filming a series in Minecraft, link to the project. Because of the war in Ukraine, this project has been greatly transformed and the epicenter of events has become post-apocalyptic Russia, but I don't feel like continuing it. Most likely I will rework this story and it will become a satirical horror quest.

In the second row, in the center is an example of people's sighing for biological weapons, Alsina Dimitrescu, and flanked by examples of what a post-apocalyptic world might look like.

Seven is an almost indecipherable box of mentats from Fallout.  
Eighth is the gorgeous Sarah Brightman from the film adaptation of Repo\! The Genetic Opera.  
The ninth is Jacob's glitch from the movie Jacob's Ladder.

The third row is quite devoted to the consequences, legalization of drugs and their use at the state level.

Tenth is Mardroeme from The Whiter.  
The eleventh is Little Joe.  
The twelfth is The rat king from The Last of Us.

The last, fourth row is about mushrooms, continuing and developing the idea of the effects of narcotic drugs, but mushrooms have a different tone in culture, which I describe in more detail in my article on horror and drugs.

The passover here is something that may not be immediately noticeable: in each of the rows, something related to beauty stands in the very center. In the first three rows there are women, in the last row there is a flower.

## **Section Two: Culture**

Here the face of the Scandinavian goddess of death Hela is at the very center, around which her many "worshippers" revolve. This is a metaphor for the cycle of violence in which the runners pass the baton to each other.

### **Hela's "fans" values (tags):**

**\#mythology** and **\#folklore** \- folklore in my understanding is a polygon of mythology. Everything that happens now and becomes urban legends, with age can become part of mythology or even firmly planted on the same level as official religion in the form of folk wisdom, omens or superstitions, holidays. The fandoms of the youngest gods are imbued with the theme of death and, in general, the very existence of any religion is based solely on speculation about the event of when death will come. Death is the center. Or sausages (Pratchett reference).

**\#industrialization** is always about development, but as I recall in regards to spears *"The Dwarves dug them too greedily and too deep. You know who they have awakened in the darkness of Casad-dûm...Darkness and fire*.*"* (c.) Saruman

Spoiler: the dwarves of Moria died, and it's probably one of the few times in history that the deaths of miners went beyond the established limits of collateral damage. More on such damage a bit below.

**\#militarism** – comes when beliefs don't work, the attacker is sure of his success and/or something prevents industrialization or trade. I associate this term with the Jolly Roger, a flag from pirate stories actively exploited not only by PMCs but also by some regular armies. This symbol is memorable and clearly explains the intentions, besides, once pirates were offered to become privateers. It is difficult to find an army without the figurative symbolism of skull and bones.

**\#necro-fetishism** \- it's like the political speech described in George Orwell's Politics and the English Language:

*\>\> Political speech and writing is in large part a justification of things for which there is no justification. Therefore, political language should consist mostly of euphemisms, tautologies and all kinds of vagueness and vagueness".*

*\>\> Example: during the presidency of George W. Bush Jr. "civilian casualties" in Iraq became "collateral damage.*

### **My definition of the signs of necro-fetishism**

* Necrofetishism is present in many spheres of life, although it rarely becomes ubiquitous, it all depends on the region in question on the planet;  
* Necrofetishism is relevant in situations when a person's life does not go according to plan, becomes too extreme, or simply a person tries to get used to the idea that he or she can die at any moment beyond his or her control. The Chinese principle of *"don't be where you can be killed"* doesn't work.

### **Necro-fetishism in history**

In traditional religious interpretations, the goddess Hel was associated with all the key processes of death, as she is the maiden-place in which the dead will one day find themselves. Helheim, the realm of the dead, was often referred to simply by the name of its ruler.

The Norse cry "Til Valhalla\!" translates to "Go to Valhalla," but if you shout "Til Hell\!" – it translates to Hel. I admit that the process of death for ordinary people, who did not fall by the death of warriors, could be seen as a sexual connection with the goddess, because sex is a universal model of reconciliation. With the idea of the inevitability of death, among other things.

The military sector seems to be thinking and pin-ups with naked women riding on weapons of mass destruction are an example of this. Sexual excitement, even a glimpse of it, arises in the mind of a person in mortal danger and is often more useful than other desires. Such creativity appeals to primitive instincts, small manifestations of which exist even under a peaceful sky.

Speaking of female guns: I believe that necrofetishism is often not only about dead flesh, but also about the crossbreeding of the dead with the living, as the first picture in the second section vividly demonstrates with the foot of a girl with a heel growing out of her heel. The American Horror Story franchise loves themes like this (the tentpole woman, the hoof-heeled woman, the couch woman). Another controversial example is the Japanese horror Iron Man. This crossbreeding with an inanimate household object can mean many things, including an emphasis on the possibility of exploiting a living body.

I've read about cases during the Middle Ages of captive women having their limbs chopped off and what was left became a "sex doll". Today, it's not hard to find porn comics with a similar plot, and severed heads of women with brightly colored makeup flirting with their executioners. Such micro-insertions have so permeated modern culture that it's as easy to miss it in a movie declared a comedy as it is to eventually forget that there's a picture of Marilyn Monroe taped to the windshield of a manned car.

*Who the hell cares what her name is? Your job is to remain effective or effectively sacrifice yourself and a damn expensive car*.

### **Mythpunk**

When talking about this genre, I pay a lot of attention to the fact that not only short stories are born from myths, but also religions \- some of the most meaningful stories in this genre. Later, when these stories are stronger, they cease to simply delight the listener and begin to explain to him the rules of life and death.

So, the Culture section is devoted to the conditions and events that provoke to listen to the doctrines of religions that teach us to organize our lives around death.

**Copywrites**  
Hovering over one of the tags in the roundelay will play the final verse of the song Sonne by Rammstein in Skold's rendition. I will remind you that musicians far from immediately settled on the idea of the video, where industrialization, folklore and drugs are in the center. The sun could have been dedicated to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which I mention in my other post.

### **Frame Description**

The first one is American Horror Story, Freak Show.  
The second is Ash's girlfriend's head in a vice-like grip flirting with her beau.  
The third is like a mirror image of the first foot, but here the heel is the sixth toe in Grendel's mother's foot, fathered by the seduced Beowulf from the 2007 animation.

The first row is devoted to necrofetishism and folklore.

The fourth is Carpenter's Viking meets The Thing from the comic book The Thing From Another World (1991).  
The fifth is my (I can't draw) drawing of a mechanized Hela inspired by Metropolis from my Fallout 4 Survivor fanfic story. Deciding to Ukrainianize the cyborg a bit, I put a wreath of flowers on her head.  
The seventh is Naru, who challenged the Predator in Prey. My Hela's lasers from above seem to be sliding on the forehead of the girl below, although I added Naru not only for the sake of completeness of the picture, but simply as an example of the people who learned militarism.  
The sixth is the Punisher's skull on the uniform of a Norwegian fighter of the Telemark Battalion.

The second row is devoted to militarism and industrialization.

The seventh is the Davy Jones organ, the ninth is the Kiev crematorium and they are like Hel: she is a goddess-place, the organ is a musical instrument "fused" with the room, the crematorium is a place that receives and as if directly into another world takes dead bodies out of itself.

Well, also the organ and crematorium sometimes have similar pipes, but in practice (looked it up) rarely.

The third row is not dedicated to anything specific, it complements the second row and reminds us of death.

## **Section Three: Insanity Forever**

This section summarizes all of the above. Not always the most daring dreamers end up in a madhouse, but more often than not, ordinary people end up in a madhouse.

### **About the madness**

The methods of treating the mentally ill today are strikingly different than they used to be, as I mention in my post.

### **About faith**

Next to the Houses of Sorrow tag is the Faith tag, which is dedicated to modern, more often monotheistic religions that have incorporated the old customs and manners of previously popular gods.

I am reminded of the tale of Mary's Child (Our Lady's Foster) about the Virgin Mary who steals children from a liar. It is noticeable how young this tale is and it is obvious that the Virgin Mary was replaced by another goddess, which is why the tale has survived to this day.

### **About dreams**

Dreams can be large-scale, like the explosion of the moon that goes beyond the limits of everyday life, or on the contrary, they can be mundane, when you want that this new day will not repeat what happened all the time. Dreams are sometimes akin to blueprints, where every step the dreamer plans and carefully calculates the risks, but most often dreams are moths striving for extraneous lights.

Dreams are people's guiding stars and when people go out, the light also goes out in their worlds, which were visited more or less often by dreamers. That last thing that not everyone will be lucky enough to see, but only those who have had their deaths delayed, is their Sky Fall. The tortured gift of a world that waited for a moment to ease the last moments of its creator. The same white light and other pre-death hallucinations.

### **Dreampunk**

What do Alice from Alice: Madness Returns and Leonardo DiCaprio from Island of the Damned have in common? They didn't come back.

So, the third section summarizes all of the above with a disappointing diagnosis of the survivors of the previous two sections, but on the other hand Joker said he was normal in his own way and Mabel burst the bubble Bill created for her.

**Copywrites**  
When you select one of the two tags, the chorus of Sweet Dreams performed by Marilyn Manson with acoustic accompaniment by Tyler Bates is played. By the way, earlier Sweet Dreams performed by the singer was played at the end of the movie House on Haunted Hill (1999).

### **Frame Description**

Here they are not ordered, but chaotically scattered. Among them:

The gateway to Arkham Asylum.  
The painting that graced the cover of The Opium Wars.  
One of Batman's first deaths from the comic book An Innocent Guy (Batman Black and White).  
The Hanging Rabbit from Alice Madness Returns.  
A station from the game Batman Arkham Asylum.  
Apache helicopter.  
Batman and his new death in 2024 (more in my post).  
Hanged Longshanks.  
Rotten from Cuando Acecha La Maldad.  
One oilman hands another a bucket of oil.  
*Volunteer at* the screen adaptation of Alastair Reynolds' book "Beyond the Aquila Rift" as part of Love. Death. Robots.  
A drawing dedicated to the aforementioned fairy tale "Mary's Child".  
The altar in the village from Resident Evil: The Village.  
The fox of the Antichrist claiming \- "Chaos rules all."  
Sigourney Weaver kisses an Alien.  
Hannibal Lecter's treat for Clarice.  
And typical local Slavic folklore: dumplings, a micro-bath filled with sour cream, a doll inside \- I was dabbling in this as part of my old photo shoot "On the Giant's Table" when I was not sober. Kringe must live.

# **Moral of the story**

In these three sections there is a series of violence that might look like, "All humans are monsters" or "This man is a fan of Nabokov's language."

I'd be happy to have you personally interpret what you see, but I'll still say what I thought in creating this myself.

1. First comes dope in every possible form;  
2. Then the reaping begins;  
3. Later, the physical survivors of the harvest become sick mentally, mentally, because humans are not spiders and cannibalism is unnatural to them.

Soon the survivors will experience a new stupefaction and then a new harvest will come, but in this cycle there is no good or evil. You might be interested in a selection from the madness section: "The World Through the Eyes of Monsters".

Absolutely everything above is evidence of the need to build good communication between people. And if we are looking for "evil" – evil is the one who deliberately hinders communication.

# **The magic ball at the bottom**

This is a reference to the Ouija sessions I mentioned, which still stir people's minds to this day. People dream of seeing their deceased loved ones again or knowing what the future holds for them because they are scared. These are natural desires and it's a shame that someone is trying to capitalize on it.

At the very bottom is my magic ball, and inside it will change random horror quotes from my collection when you click on the "Guess" button. I wonder which one will fall out for you.
